# Helm charts Trainings

This collection of Helm Charts is tailored for datascientists trainings.  
It is primarly designed to work with [Onyxia](https://github.com/inseefrlab/onyxia) but also works as a standalone Helm repository.  
See the other repository ([Helm charts](https://github.com/inseefrlab/helm-charts-datascience)) for datascientist tools charts.  

To use the repo on helm (version 3+) :
```
helm repo add inseefrlab-trainings https://inseefrlab.github.io/helm-charts-trainings
```  

The repo is also browsable directly https://inseefrlab.github.io/helm-charts-trainings/index.yaml
